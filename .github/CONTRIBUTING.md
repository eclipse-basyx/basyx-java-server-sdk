# How to contribute to BaSyx

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in BaSyx**, and instead refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk/security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **BaSyx configuration** including relevant **AAS files (AASX, JSON, XML)** for reproducing the issue.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to BaSyx](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk/blob/main/.github/CODING_CONVENTIONS.md) guide to know more about coding conventions.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of BaSyx will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change using the `feature request` template when opening a new issue.

* Do not open a pull request until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use BaSyx in the [BaSyx Dev mailing list](mailto:basyx-dev@eclipse.org).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the BaSyx documentation?**

* Please go to the [basyx-wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-wiki) repository and create a PR there.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
