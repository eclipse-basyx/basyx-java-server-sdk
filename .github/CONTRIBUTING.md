# How to contribute to BaSyx

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse BaSyx collects the implementation results of the research project BaSys
4.0. An essential goal of BaSys 4.0 is the use of IT technology for production
systems to enable the concepts of the new Industrie 4.0 paradigm. It develops a
middleware that integrates traditional production systems (e.g. PLC controllers)
and state-of-the art IT technology (BPMN engine, SOA) to enable next generation
of production automation.
