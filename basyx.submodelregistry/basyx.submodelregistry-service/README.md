# Basyx Submodel Registry Service

The base server implementation was generated by the [openAPI generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin) project.  

It is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and logs shell or submodel registration-updates. The storage implementation is missing. You can either use the inMemory implementation or mongoDb implementation provided by sibling projects or implement your storage.

Use the basyx.submodelregistry-basemodel project if you want to use just POJOs generated out of the OpenAPI description. You can also generate or implement other model classes with specific annotations as we do it for the mongodb-storage implementation.
