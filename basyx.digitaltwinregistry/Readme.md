# Eclipse BaSyx - Digital Twin Registry Prototype
This maven module contains a prototype of the DTR implementation and provides test cases for the Tractus-X Challenge. 

## Testcases from eclipse-tractusx-digital-twin-registry
The test classes `AssetAdministrationShellApiSecurityTest` and `AssetAdministrationShellApiTest` are copied from the repository [eclipse-tractusx-digitaltwinr-registry](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-digital-twin-registry) and run against the basyx-digital-twin-registry.
The goal is to identify the differences between both digital-twin registries and merge their behaviors.
